# SELECT Queries

SELECT queries are used to fetch data from a database. In its simplest form, a SELECT query consists of the following clauses:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

The `SELECT` clause specifies which columns we want to select from the table. The `FROM` clause specifies the table from which we want to select data.

## SELECT ALL

To select all columns from a table, we can use the `*` wildcard:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```

## Try it out

```json
{
    
}
```
